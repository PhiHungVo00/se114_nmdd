# CINESTREAM - App booking cinema ticket
*A cross-platform cinema-ticket booking system*

CINESTREAM lets moviegoers browse showtimes, choose seats and pay securely from an Android app while cinema staff manage films, schedules and sales via an admin portal.  
The solution is split into a **Python + Flask REST API** (with MySQL) and a **native Android (Java)** client, so you can run the server anywhere and point multiple apps to it.

## 📦 Project Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huypro2005/se114_nmdd.git
```



🖥️ Backend Setup (Python)
➡️ Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

➡️ Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend_python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

➡️ Configure Environment Variables
Edit the file ./backend_python/.env and update the following values:
```bash
KEY='restfull_api'
DB_HOST={HOST}
DB_PORT={PORT}
DB_USER={USER}
DB_PASSWORD={PASSWORD}
DB_NAME='firmmanagement'
```

📌 Replace {HOST}, {PORT}, {USER}, {PASSWORD} with your actual MySQL connection details.

➡️ Create Database in MySQL
Open your MySQL client and run:
```bash
CREATE DATABASE firmmanagement;
```

Then import data from the provided backup_data.sql file.

➡️ Run Backend Server

```bash
cd backend_python
python run.py
```

✅ If successful, you should see:
```bash
Checking if database tables exist...
Database tables created successfully.

📱 Frontend Setup (Android)
➡️ Open Project
Open the frontend_java folder in Android Studio.

➡️ Configure Backend URL
Edit the file frontend_java/local.properties and add:

```bash
BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.8:5000
```

📌 Make sure to replace 192.168.1.8 with your actual local IP address (same IP where backend is running).

## Account
```bash
- User: 
username: user
password: 123456

- Admin
username: admin
password: admin
```



✅ Notes
Ensure the database is created before running the backend.

This backend uses Flask development server — for production use, consider deploying with a WSGI server like gunicorn or uWSGI.

Frontend is built using Java + Android Studio.
